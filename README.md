# Golang Repetier-Server API Client library

build / install / reference things in the usual way:

`go get -v github.com/fuzzy/repetier`

The Makefile is really only useful for running the tests. Which by the way,
require you to have a tests/test-fixture-data.json with your api configuration
details.
